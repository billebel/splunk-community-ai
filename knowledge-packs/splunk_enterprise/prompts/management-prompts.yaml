         - How many records? Any obvious issues?

      2. **Lookup Optimization**
         - Suggest optimal field names (follow Splunk conventions)
         - Determine lookup type: exact, CIDR, wildcard
         - Identify key field for matching
         - Recommend any data enrichment

      3. **Quality Checks**
         - Data validation issues
         - Size and performance concerns
         - Security considerations
         - Missing or malformed entries

      - Add threat score if missing
      - Suggest: indicator, indicator_type, threat_level, source
      - Multiple lookup types based on data

      ## IMPORTANT RULES
      - Always provide clean, working CSV output
      - Field names should be lowercase with underscores
      - Include header row in CSV
      - Escape commas and quotes properly
      - If data is invalid, explain how to fix it

      ## SPL BEST PRACTICES

      **Performance:**
      - Always specify index when possible
      - Use time bounds (earliest/latest)
      - Put most selective filters first
      - Use stats/eval efficiently

      **Safety:**
      - Never include: delete, collect, outputcsv append=false
      - Avoid broad wildcards without index
      - Include reasonable time windows

      **Reusability:**
      - Parameterize key values
      - Use descriptive field names
      - Include helpful comments

      ## COMMON PATTERNS

      **Security Analysis:**
      ```spl
      index=security action=failure
      | stats count by user, src_ip
      | where count > $threshold$
      ```

      **Performance Monitoring:**
      ```spl
      index=web response_time>0
      | stats avg(response_time) as avg_time, perc95(response_time) as p95_time by host
      ```

      **Error Detection:**
      ```spl
      index=application (ERROR OR FATAL OR Exception)
      | rex field=_raw "(?<error_type>\w+Error|\w+Exception)"
      | stats count by error_type, host
      ```

      ## BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE EXAMPLES

      **Security Monitoring (Critical):**
      - Needs frequent execution (5-15 min intervals)
      - Must avoid exact hour boundaries (:00) due to collision
      - Suggest staggered times: :07, :22, :37, :52
      - Consider 24/7 operation with reduced frequency off-hours

      **Executive Reports (High Priority):**
      - Must complete before business day starts
      - Schedule with 2-3 hour buffer before deadline
      - Use off-peak computational resources (2am-6am)
      - Consider weekend processing for heavy analysis

      **Compliance Reports (Medium Priority):**
      - Can tolerate flexible timing
      - Ideal for weekend or off-hours execution
      - Monthly/weekly cadence often sufficient
      - Good candidates for low-priority resource allocation

      **Real-time Dashboards (Variable):**
      - Balance freshness vs performance impact
      - More frequent during business hours, reduced after hours
      - Consider summary indexing for heavy calculations
      - Use efficient tstats when possible

      ## CONFLICT RESOLUTION STRATEGIES

      **Time Staggering:**
      - Distribute across :15, :30, :45 minute marks
      - Use prime number offsets (7, 11, 13 minutes)
      - Avoid common collision points (:00, :30)

      **Resource Prioritization:**
      - Critical searches get priority time slots
      - Background analytics use off-peak hours
      - Heavy processing scheduled for maintenance windows

      **Performance Optimization:**
      - Suggest search optimizations to reduce runtime
      - Recommend data model usage for frequent patterns
      - Identify summary indexing opportunities

      ## INTELLIGENT SCHEDULING PATTERNS

      **For High-Frequency Searches (< 15 min):**
      ```
      Pattern: Avoid clustering at common intervals
      Good: */7 * * * * (every 7 minutes)
      Bad:  */5 * * * * (every 5 minutes - common collision)
      ```

      **For Daily Reports:**
      ```
      Pattern: Complete before business day with buffer
      Good: 30 5 * * * (5:30am daily)
      Bad:  0 8 * * * (8:00am - cuts it close)
      ```

      **For Weekly Reports:**
      ```
      Pattern: Use weekend processing time
      Good: 0 2 * * 0 (Sunday 2am)
      Bad:  0 9 * * 1 (Monday 9am - peak time)
      ```

      Remember: Consider the human impact - a search that's slightly less optimal but meets business needs is better than a perfectly optimized search that misses deadlines.

      - Expensive join operations
      - Frequently accessed datasets
      - Complex field extractions
      ```

      **Panel Optimization:**
      ```
      - Limit panels to 8-12 for optimal performance
      - Use post-process searches from base searches
      - Implement progressive loading for complex dashboards
      - Cache results where appropriate
      ```

      **Refresh Intelligence:**
      ```
      - Real-time needs: 30 seconds - 2 minutes
      - Business monitoring: 5-15 minutes
      - Executive reporting: 1-4 hours
      - Compliance tracking: Daily
      ```

      ## LAYOUT PRINCIPLES

      **Information Hierarchy:**
      - **Top row**: Most critical metrics (single values, key trends)
      - **Middle section**: Primary analysis (main charts, tables)
      - **Bottom section**: Supporting details (drill-downs, auxiliary data)

      **Visual Flow:**
      - **Left to right**: Temporal flow (past ‚Üí present ‚Üí future)
      - **Top to bottom**: Priority order (critical ‚Üí supporting)
      - **Grouping**: Related metrics clustered together

      **Responsive Design:**
      - **Wide panels**: For trend analysis and detailed tables
      - **Square panels**: For single metrics and gauges
      - **Narrow panels**: For status indicators and sparklines
